## IslandoraCon 2025 Call For Proposals

On behalf of the Islandora Foundation, we invite submission of proposals for IslandoraCon 2025, taking place July 14-17, 2025, online.

The theme of IslandoraCon 2025 is: All in on Islandora.

IslandoraCon brings together a community of librarians, archivists, cultural heritage collections managers, technologists, developers, project managers, and open source project enthusiasts in support of the Islandora framework for digital curation and asset management.

We welcome proposals on a wide range of topics related to managing collections with Islandora, developing Drupal modules and software support for Islandora, and Islandora community initiatives and interests. These may include:
* Digital accessibility
* Workflows, policies, and training
* Multimedia viewers and displays
* Institutional repository requirements, migrations and integrations
* Metadata
* Documentation
* User testing
* Bots, site performance, and security
* Drupal versions, updates, modules, and potential integrations
* Islandora architecture and affordances
* Digital preservation workflows and integrations
* Digital exhibits
* Assessment and metrics

We anticipate having a variety of session formats, including lightning talks (5 minutes), individual presentations, panel discussions, and longer workshops, training, or troubleshooting sessions. Sessions will be 25 or 50 minutes, which includes time for questions. The planning committee is open to additional suggestions for session formats â€“ in your proposal, please indicate what kind of format you think will best fit your topic and presenters.  All sessions will be streamed and/or recorded.

If you have an idea for a session and are looking for co-organizers or co-presenters, please post in the IslandoraCon 2025 Slack channel!

Deadline for session proposals: February 28, 2025. Please use this [Google form for proposal submissions](https://forms.gle/evK99y7rSdRYQLit8). If you have questions about proposal format or submission, please post in the IslandoraCon 2025 Slack channel or email IslandoraCon 2025 chairs [Cory Lampert](mailto:cory.lampert@unlv.edu) or [Cary Gordon](mailto:cgordon@chillco.com). We look forward to seeing you there!
